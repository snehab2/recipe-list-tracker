# recipe-list-tracker
A site where users can keep track of recipes they want to learn.

## about
One of my goals for 2022 is to learn how to cook, so I decided to create a website where I can keep track of the recipes I want to learn/have learned as well as improve my JavaScript skills. It's currently in a work in progress as I'm relearning Javascript. 

## resources used
- Kode with Klossy 2020 web development curriculum
- [MDN Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
- [jQuery API reference sheet](https://api.jquery.com/)
- Replit
- Coolors

## viewing the project
You can check out the website [here](https://Recipe-List.sneyeah.repl.co)

## future iterations
- Check off completed/learned recipes and put them in a completed/learned recipes column
- Order recipes from easiest, shortest recipes to hardiest, longest recipes
